            <h2>Vehicle Purchases and Reservations</h2>
            <h3>Vehicle Information</h3>
            <p>
              While we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of information regarding Vehicles
              listed on our website, including specifications, features, pricing, and availability, we
              cannot guarantee that all information is complete or error-free. All Vehicles are
              subject to prior sale.
            </p>

            <h3>Reservations and Deposits</h3>
            <p>
              To reserve a Vehicle, you may be required to pay a reservation deposit. This deposit is
              refundable only under specific circumstances outlined in our Refund Policy. A
              reservation does not constitute a final sale and is subject to availability and
              confirmation.
            </p>

            <h3>Purchase Process</h3>
            <p>
              The purchase of a Vehicle requires:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                A signed purchase agreement outlining the terms of sale, including price, payment
                schedule, and delivery details.
              </li>
              <li>
                Payment in full, unless financing arrangements have been approved by us.
              </li>
              <li>
                Provision of all required documentation, including identification, proof of address,
                and any documents required for international shipping and customs clearance.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Payment and Pricing</h2>
            <h3>Currency and Payment Methods</h3>
            <p>
              All prices are listed in British Pounds Sterling (GBP). We accept payment by bank
              transfer, credit card, or other methods specified at the time of purchase. For payments
              in other currencies, the exchange rate will be determined at the time of transaction.
            </p>

            <h3>Taxes and Duties</h3>
            <p>
              The purchase price does not include import duties, taxes, or customs fees that may be
              levied by Kenyan or Tanzanian authorities. These additional costs are the
              responsibility of the Customer and are payable directly to the relevant authorities.
            </p>

            <h2>Shipping and Delivery</h2>
            <h3>Shipping Process</h3>
            <p>
              We will arrange for the shipping of Vehicles from the UK to Kenya or Tanzania as
              specified in the purchase agreement. The shipping process includes:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Preparation of the Vehicle for export from the UK</li>
              <li>Arrangement of sea freight or air freight, as applicable</li>
              <li>
                Completion of necessary export documentation from the UK
              </li>
              <li>
                Coordination with our local partners in Kenya or Tanzania for customs clearance
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Delivery Timeframes</h3>
            <p>
              While we provide estimated delivery timeframes, actual delivery times may vary due to
              factors beyond our control, including but not limited to shipping delays, customs
              clearance, and local transportation issues. We will keep you informed of any significant
              delays.
            </p>

            <h3>Delivery Condition</h3>
            <p>
              All Vehicles will be delivered in substantially the same condition as described at the
              time of purchase, allowing for normal wear and tear during shipping. You have the right
              to inspect the Vehicle upon delivery before accepting it.
            </p>

            <h2>Warranties and Returns</h2>
            <h3>Warranty Coverage</h3>
            <p>
              All Vehicles are sold with any remaining manufacturer's warranty, if applicable. We
              provide an additional 3-month limited warranty covering major mechanical components,
              subject to the terms outlined in our separate Warranty Policy.
            </p>

            <h3>Return Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the nature of international Vehicle sales, returns are generally not accepted
              after a Vehicle has been shipped. However, if a Vehicle is significantly different from
              its description or has undisclosed major defects, you may be entitled to remedies as
              outlined in our separate Return Policy.
            </p>
